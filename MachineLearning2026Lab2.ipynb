    "You are to perform preprocessing and exploratory analysis of a data set: exploring the statistical summaries of the features, visualizing the attributes, and addressing data quality. This report is worth 10% of the final grade. Please upload a report (one per team) with all code used, visualizations, and text in a rendered Jupyter notebook. Any visualizations that cannot be embedded in the notebook, please provide screenshots of the output.\n",

    "Dataset requirements: Choose a dataset that is comprised of image data. The data should be directories of images. That is, the dataset should not yet be pre-processed. The following are required for the dataset:\n",
    "\n",
    "The data includes at least 1000 images\n",
    "The size of the images should be larger than 20x20 pixels \n",
    "The dataset should have a well defined prediction task (i.e., a label for each image)\n",
    "The dataset cannot be MNIST or Fashion MNIST \n",
    "A note on grading: This lab is mostly about visualizing and understanding your dataset. The largest share of the points is from how you interpret the visuals that you make. Making the visuals is not enough to satisfy each of the rubrics below—you should appropriately explain what the implications of the visualizations are. In other words, expect about 20% of the available points for visuals that have no substantive discussion. "
